				## **Landforms Found in the Tundra**

				## 1. **Permafrost**
				- Permafrost is a key feature of the tundra landscape, referring to the permanently frozen layer of soil or rock beneath the surface.
				- It prevents deep-rooted plant growth and creates unique hydrological conditions, causing the formation of features like ice wedges and thermokarst.

				## 2. **Frost Heaves**
				- Frost heaves occur when water in the soil freezes and thaws, causing the soil to move upward in irregular lumps.
				- These landforms are common in tundra areas with permafrost and can lead to the uneven surface of the ground.

				## 3. **Tundra Ponds and Lakes**
				- Tundra regions often feature small ponds, lakes, and marshes, particularly in areas with seasonal thawing.
				- These bodies of water are formed as a result of melting snow and ice during the short summer months, but many dry up again in the winter.

				## 4. **Glacial Features (Moraines, Erratics, and Fjords)**
				- Glaciers are prevalent in the tundra, particularly in the Arctic regions, and have shaped the landscape over millions of years.
				- **Moraines** are ridges of debris left by moving glaciers, while **erratics** are large boulders transported by glaciers from one area to another.
				- **Fjords** are steep, glacially-carved valleys that are filled with seawater, often seen along the coasts of Arctic regions.

				## 5. **Ice Wedges**
				- Ice wedges are cracks that form in the ground due to the freezing and thawing of water in permafrost areas.
				- When water fills cracks and freezes, it expands and causes the ground to crack further, forming wedge-like shapes.

				## 6. **Tundra Hills and Ridges**
				- Many tundra landscapes are characterized by low, rounded hills and ridges formed by glacial action or erosion.
				- These features are often covered with low-lying vegetation and sparse plant life, typical of tundra ecosystems.
