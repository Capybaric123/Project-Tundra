				## **Impact of Humans and Human Activities on the Tundra**

				## 1. **Climate Change and Global Warming**
				- Rising temperatures due to human-driven climate change are causing **permafrost** to thaw at an accelerating rate, which disrupts ecosystems and releases **methane** and **carbon dioxide** stored in the permafrost.
				- Thawing permafrost can lead to the loss of habitats for animals and plants, disrupt traditional human lifestyles in the Arctic, and create dangerous ground instability.

				## 2. **Oil and Gas Extraction**
				- **Oil drilling** and **gas extraction** are major industrial activities in tundra regions, especially in Alaska, Siberia, and northern Canada.
				- These activities can lead to **habitat destruction**, **pollution**, and **oil spills**, which harm wildlife and the delicate tundra ecosystem.
				- The construction of pipelines and infrastructure for oil and gas can fragment habitats and disturb migration routes for animals like caribou.

				## 3. **Mining and Resource Extraction**
				- The tundra is rich in natural resources such as **minerals**, **coal**, and **precious metals**, leading to mining activities in some regions.
				- Mining operations often lead to **soil degradation**, **pollution of water sources**, and the destruction of plant and animal habitats.
				- The extraction process can leave lasting scars on the landscape, including toxic waste dumps and contamination from heavy metals.

				## 4. **Tourism**
				- As tourism increases in the Arctic and tundra regions, there are concerns about the **disturbance of wildlife** and **disruption of ecosystems**.
				- Tourists can damage fragile tundra vegetation by trampling, introduce invasive species, and contribute to pollution through waste and litter.
				- Infrastructure development for tourism, such as roads, hotels, and airstrips, leads to habitat fragmentation and increased human presence in sensitive areas.

				## 5. **Military Activities**
				- Military operations in the tundra, such as testing weapons and constructing bases, have significant ecological impacts.
				- These activities cause **soil compaction**, **pollution**, and can disturb local wildlife populations, especially migratory birds and caribou.
				- Additionally, military infrastructure, including roads and airstrips, disrupts the natural landscape and migratory corridors.

				## 6. **Overhunting and Overfishing**
				- Human activities such as **overhunting** of tundra wildlife (like caribou, seals, and polar bears) and **overfishing** in the Arctic seas can deplete important species.
				- The depletion of these species disrupts food webs and local Indigenous peoples' ways of life, who rely on these animals for sustenance and cultural practices.
				- Some species, such as polar bears, are also severely impacted by climate change and hunting, further threatening their survival.

				## 7. **Invasive Species**
				- The introduction of **non-native species** to tundra regions, often through human activity like shipping, tourism, or research, can threaten local biodiversity.
				- Invasive species outcompete native plants and animals for resources, leading to the decline of endemic species.
				- This disrupts the balance of the tundra ecosystem and can alter the natural structure of plant and animal communities.
