			<h2>Impact of Humans and Human Activities on the Tundra</h2>

			<h3>1. Climate Change and Global Warming</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Rising temperatures due to human-driven climate change are causing <strong>permafrost</strong> to thaw at an accelerating rate, which disrupts ecosystems and releases <strong>methane</strong> and <strong>carbon dioxide</strong> stored in the permafrost.</li>
				<li>Thawing permafrost can lead to the loss of habitats for animals and plants, disrupt traditional human lifestyles in the Arctic, and create dangerous ground instability.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>2. Oil and Gas Extraction</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Oil drilling</strong> and <strong>gas extraction</strong> are major industrial activities in tundra regions, especially in Alaska, Siberia, and northern Canada.</li>
				<li>These activities can lead to <strong>habitat destruction</strong>, <strong>pollution</strong>, and <strong>oil spills</strong>, which harm wildlife and the delicate tundra ecosystem.</li>
				<li>The construction of pipelines and infrastructure for oil and gas can fragment habitats and disturb migration routes for animals like caribou.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>3. Mining and Resource Extraction</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The tundra is rich in natural resources such as <strong>minerals</strong>, <strong>coal</strong>, and <strong>precious metals</strong>, leading to mining activities in some regions.</li>
				<li>Mining operations often lead to <strong>soil degradation</strong>, <strong>pollution of water sources</strong>, and the destruction of plant and animal habitats.</li>
				<li>The extraction process can leave lasting scars on the landscape, including toxic waste dumps and contamination from heavy metals.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>4. Tourism</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>As tourism increases in the Arctic and tundra regions, there are concerns about the <strong>disturbance of wildlife</strong> and <strong>disruption of ecosystems</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tourists can damage fragile tundra vegetation by trampling, introduce invasive species, and contribute to pollution through waste and litter.</li>
				<li>Infrastructure development for tourism, such as roads, hotels, and airstrips, leads to habitat fragmentation and increased human presence in sensitive areas.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>5. Military Activities</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Military operations in the tundra, such as testing weapons and constructing bases, have significant ecological impacts.</li>
				<li>These activities cause <strong>soil compaction</strong>, <strong>pollution</strong>, and can disturb local wildlife populations, especially migratory birds and caribou.</li>
				<li>Additionally, military infrastructure, including roads and airstrips, disrupts the natural landscape and migratory corridors.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>6. Overhunting and Overfishing</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Human activities such as <strong>overhunting</strong> of tundra wildlife (like caribou, seals, and polar bears) and <strong>overfishing</strong> in the Arctic seas can deplete important species.</li>
				<li>The depletion of these species disrupts food webs and local Indigenous peoples' ways of life, who rely on these animals for sustenance and cultural practices.</li>
				<li>Some species, such as polar bears, are also severely impacted by climate change and hunting, further threatening their survival.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>7. Invasive Species</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The introduction of <strong>non-native species</strong> to tundra regions, often through human activity like shipping, tourism, or research, can threaten local biodiversity.</li>
				<li>Invasive species outcompete native plants and animals for resources, leading to the decline of endemic species.</li>
				<li>This disrupts the balance of the tundra ecosystem and can alter the natural structure of plant and animal communities.</li>
