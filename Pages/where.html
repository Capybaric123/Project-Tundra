			<ul>
				<li>The tundra is a cold, treeless biome that is primarily found in regions with low temperatures, short growing seasons, and little precipitation.</li>
				<li>It is mainly located in the northernmost parts of the world, specifically in the Arctic and Alpine regions.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Arctic Tundra</strong> is located around the <strong>North Pole</strong>, stretching across parts of <strong>North America</strong>, <strong>Europe</strong>, and <strong>Asia</strong>, including countries like Canada, Alaska (USA), Greenland, Russia, and parts of Scandinavia.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Alpine Tundra</strong> is found at high altitudes on mountain ranges worldwide, even near the equator, such as in the <strong>Rocky Mountains</strong> in North America, the <strong>Andes</strong> in South America, the <strong>Himalayas</strong> in Asia, and the <strong>Alps</strong> in Europe.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Arctic Tundra</strong> covers vast areas, including the <strong>Siberian Tundra</strong> in Russia and the <strong>Canadian Tundra</strong>, with temperatures that can drop to as low as -50°C (-58°F) in winter.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Alpine Tundra</strong> is not tied to any specific continent and occurs in regions where the elevation is high enough to produce tundra-like conditions, regardless of latitude.</li>
				<li>The tundra is found in areas with permafrost—permanently frozen ground—underneath the soil, which prevents most plant life from growing deeper roots.</li>
