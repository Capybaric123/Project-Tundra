				# Animals Found in the Tundra

				## Arctic Fox

				The **Arctic Fox** is a small mammal that thrives in the extreme cold of the tundra. It has a thick, insulating coat that changes color with the seasons, providing camouflage against the snowy landscape in winter and rocky terrain in summer.

				- **Diet**: Carnivorous, feeding on small mammals like lemmings, birds, and carrion.
				- **Adaptations**: Its round body shape helps conserve heat, and its paws are covered with fur to provide warmth and traction on icy ground.
				- **Behavior**: It has a wide range of vocalizations and is known to be solitary, except during the breeding season.

				## Caribou (Reindeer)

				**Caribou**, also known as reindeer in Europe, are large herbivores well adapted to the tundra's cold and harsh environment. Their hooves are large and wide, which helps them walk on snow and ice without sinking.

				- **Diet**: Herbivorous, feeding on mosses, lichens, and grasses during the summer months, and on woody plants and lichens during winter.
				- **Adaptations**: Their fur is dense and layered, with hollow hairs that trap air for insulation. Their hooves are designed to dig through snow to reach food.
				- **Behavior**: Caribou are migratory, traveling in large herds to find food and avoid harsh winter conditions.

				## Snowy Owl

				The **Snowy Owl** is a large, white owl that is perfectly camouflaged against the snow-covered tundra. They are excellent hunters, relying on their keen eyesight to locate prey in low-light conditions.

				- **Diet**: Carnivorous, feeding mainly on small mammals like lemmings, voles, and rabbits.
				- **Adaptations**: Their white feathers help them blend into the snowy landscape, and their wings are wide and silent, allowing them to swoop down on prey unnoticed.
				- **Behavior**: Snowy owls are solitary and primarily active during the day, hunting in the early morning or late evening.
