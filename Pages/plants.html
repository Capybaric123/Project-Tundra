				## 1. **Arctic Moss (Calliergon giganteum)**
				- Arctic moss is a type of moss that thrives in the cold, low-nutrient environment of the tundra.
				- It can withstand extreme cold and low light conditions, growing in dense mats that help conserve warmth and moisture.

				## 2. **Lichens (Cladonia spp.)**
				- Lichens are a symbiotic organism formed by fungi and algae or cyanobacteria.
				- They are highly resilient and grow in the harsh tundra conditions, often covering rocks and soil.
				- Lichens are important for soil formation and nitrogen fixation in tundra ecosystems.

				## 3. **Arctic Willow (Salix arctica)**
				- The Arctic willow is a low-growing shrub that can tolerate freezing temperatures and windy conditions.
				- It often forms small, bushy mats that hug the ground, protecting itself from wind damage while providing shelter for small animals.

				## 4. **Tufted Saxifrage (Saxifraga caespitosa)**
				- Tufted saxifrage is a small perennial that grows in tight rosettes, helping it survive in the tundra's cold and windy conditions.
				- It has succulent leaves that retain moisture and provide resistance against freezing temperatures.

				## 5. **Mountain Avens (Dryas octopetala)**
				- Mountain avens are hardy shrubs with white flowers and are adapted to growing in poor, rocky soil.
				- They have a deep root system that helps them survive the cold winters and dry summers of the tundra.

				## 6. **Caribou Moss (Rangiferina farinosa)**
				- Caribou moss is a type of lichen that is a crucial food source for caribou and other herbivores in the tundra.
				- It grows in a spongy mat and can tolerate very cold temperatures, making it highly resilient in harsh tundra environments.
