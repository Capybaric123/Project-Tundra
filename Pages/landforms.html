			<h2>Landforms Found in the Tundra</h2>

			<h3>1. Permafrost</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Permafrost is a key feature of the tundra landscape, referring to the permanently frozen layer of soil or rock beneath the surface.</li>
				<li>It prevents deep-rooted plant growth and creates unique hydrological conditions, causing the formation of features like ice wedges and thermokarst.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>2. Frost Heaves</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Frost heaves occur when water in the soil freezes and thaws, causing the soil to move upward in irregular lumps.</li>
				<li>These landforms are common in tundra areas with permafrost and can lead to the uneven surface of the ground.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>3. Tundra Ponds and Lakes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Tundra regions often feature small ponds, lakes, and marshes, particularly in areas with seasonal thawing.</li>
				<li>These bodies of water are formed as a result of melting snow and ice during the short summer months, but many dry up again in the winter.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>4. Glacial Features (Moraines, Erratics, and Fjords)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Glaciers are prevalent in the tundra, particularly in the Arctic regions, and have shaped the landscape over millions of years.</li>
				<li><strong>Moraines</strong> are ridges of debris left by moving glaciers, while <strong>erratics</strong> are large boulders transported by glaciers from one area to another.</li>
				<li><strong>Fjords</strong> are steep, glacially-carved valleys that are filled with seawater, often seen along the coasts of Arctic regions.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>5. Ice Wedges</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Ice wedges are cracks that form in the ground due to the freezing and thawing of water in permafrost areas.</li>
				<li>When water fills cracks and freezes, it expands and causes the ground to crack further, forming wedge-like shapes.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>6. Tundra Hills and Ridges</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Many tundra landscapes are characterized by low, rounded hills and ridges formed by glacial action or erosion.</li>
				<li>These features are often covered with low-lying vegetation and sparse plant life, typical of tundra ecosystems.</li>
			</ul>
