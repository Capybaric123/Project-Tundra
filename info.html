				# Project-Tundra

				This is a school project run on github pages and and made using my new made HTML5 framework. The framework is still private, but soon 
				I am planing on making it public.

				## How did I get the idea

				First when I was planing out the whole project I thought about what reminds me of biomes. And the first thing that came to my mind, was 
				Minecraft! I am quite familiar with this game as I even developed a few mods for this game and also I just really like it, just like any 
				other kid.

				So, now that I have the game on my mind which biome should I choose? I thought about it while looking at the list in the document and it 
				blinked right in front of my eyes... ***Tundra***, a great biome with a lot of pine trees and a great look - perfect for my project! So I 
				started working.

				## Progress

				First thing I got after the idea of a biome I should choose came the base of the project - "What should I choose?" - came flying 
				straight in my face. - "Well... I hate google sites as it doesn't give you a flexible enough base. But what should I choose then?" - And 
				then I realized that I have a framework in development right now and I could not only make a cool looking website but also improve the code 
				so I got straight to work.

				Second thing was to clone the github repository with my framework and get to work. Home page, table of contents, first page, info page, text, 
				shields.io, the README file, the github page, and just like this I'm at the point of writing this!
