# Project-Tundra

A website I made in a day or two using my HTML5 framework. (A school project) 
Here you can find interresting facts about tundra biome and learn something new! 

This website is going to be hosted on github for undefenite time.

# Overview

This is a big test for my framework which was created with my website. 
It's very cool that I can use it to help with my school project named ***Project-Tundra***. 

# Official release

I plan on releasing the framework in to the public with all of the guides maybe in a month. 
It will be visible on my github page in the repositories section. 

P.S.

I hope that I could help someone with their dream of making a website.
