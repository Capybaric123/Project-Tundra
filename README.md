# Project-Tundra
A website I made in a day or two using my HTML5 framework. (A school project)

# Overview

This is a big test for my framework which was created with my website. 
It's very cool that I can use it to help with my school project named ***Project-Tundra***. 

# Official release

I plan on releasing the framework in to the public with all of the guides maybe in a month. 
It will be visible on my github page in the repositories section. 
I hope that I could help someone with their dream of making a website.
